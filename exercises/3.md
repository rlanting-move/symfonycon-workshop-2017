# Exercise 3

## Tasks

1. Implement the [`DecodingBoard`](../src/Game/DecodingBoard.php).

    Behaviour to implement:

    * `makeGuess()` gives feedback on the guess
    * `makeGuess()` throws a NoAttemptsLeftException if number of attempts is exceeded
    * `allFeedback()` exposes all past feedback
    * `lastFeedback()` exposes the last feedback
    * `lastFeedback()` returns null for last feedback if there was no guess attempt yet
    * `isWon()` - the game is won if all colours and positions are guessed
    * `isWon()` - the game is not won if some of the colours are on wrong positions
    * `isWon()` - the game is not won if there was no guess attempt yet
    * `isLost()` - the game lost if there is no more attempts left and the code was not broken
    * `isLost()` - test the game is not lost if there is any attempts left
    * `isLost()` - the game is not lost if there is no more attempts left and the game is won
    * `isFinished()` - the game is finished if all colours and positions are guessed
    * `isFinished()` the game is not finished if there are any attempts left
    * `isFinished()` the game is finished if there is no more attempts left
    * `gameUuid()` exposes the game uuid
    * `numberOfPegs()` exposes the length of secret code

2. Implement the [`StartGameUseCase`](../src/UseCase/StartGameUseCase.php).

    Behaviour to implement:

    * `execute()` stores a new decoding board
    * `execute()` returns the game uuid

3. Implement the [`MakeGuessUseCase`](../src/UseCase/MakeGuessUseCase.php).

    Behaviour to implement:

    * `execute()` makes a guess
    * `execute()` returns a board after making a guess
    * `execute()` puts a board into the repository after making a guess

4. Implement the [`ViewDecodingBoardUseCase`](../src/UseCase/ViewDecodingBoardUseCase.php).

    Behaviour to implement:

    * `execute()` gets an existing game from the decoding boards repository
