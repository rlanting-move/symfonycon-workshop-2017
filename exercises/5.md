# Exercise 5

## Tasks

1. Create a web application.

    A Symfony application is already set up in the `src/Adapters/Web`.
    Some assets and the front controller were placed into the `public` folder.
    [templates](../src/Adapters/Web/Resources/templates) are provided but no controller is implemented.
    Some integration tests need to be written during the implementation.
